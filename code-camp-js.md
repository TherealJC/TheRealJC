# Code Camp JS

 In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. JavaScript provides seven different data types which are `undefined`, `null`, `boolean`, `string`, `symbol`, `number`, and `object`.

Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the `=` operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.

`i++;`is the equivalent of`i = i + 1;`   The entire line becomes `i++;`eliminating the need for the equal sign.  The remainder operator `%` gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

 Like the `+=` operator, `-=` subtracts a number from a variable. myVar = myVar - 5; will subtract `5` from `myVar`. This can be rewritten as: `myVar -= 5;`

 `"your name"` is called a string literal. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: `"` or `'` inside of your string? ``In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash \(`\`\) in front of the quote.`var sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";`

```text
var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\".";
Pay attention to how it ends with the last " outside the \ (\"----\") and the 
position of the .
```

 In JavaScript, when the `+` operator is used with a `String` value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.
