# Activity 4.2



1. Research and discuss how usability and user experience differ from one another.



* _Usability_ is concerned with the “effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with which specified users achieve specified goals in particular environments”, while User experience is concerned with “all aspects of the user’s experience when interacting with the product, service, environment or facility”
* **Aim:** In terms of a web site, the aim of _usability_ is to make that web site easy to use. The aim of user experience is to make the user happy before, during and after using that web site. Thus, _usability_ relates to the ease with which users can achieve their goals while interacting with a web site while user experience is concerned with the way users perceive their interaction with that web site
* **Defined as a Process**: “User experience \(UX\) design is the process of creating products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, _usability_, and function.”
* **Defined as a Question:** _Usability_ can be modeled as the question “Can the user accomplish their goal?” whilst user experience can be phrased as “Did the user have as delightful an experience as possible?” .
* **Resources Required:** _Usability_ involves those employees who influence the user interface design of a web site whilst user experience requires the collective and seamless effort of employees from various departments including engineering, _marketing_, graphical and _industrial design_ and interface design.
* **Impact:** Although user experience requires more effort to do well, its results have a better impact. When done properly, user experience effectively enhances the relationship between the user and the brand. This is because “true user experience goes far beyond giving customers what they say they want, or providing checklist features”
* **Effect on User Interface:** A usable user interface is one which is typically intuitive, simple or extremely learnable. A user interface whose aim is to create a positive user experience is one which is pleasing to the user. This does not mean that when the focus is on user experience, the user interface is not usable. To the contrary, user experience professionals typically hand over their designs to _usability_ professionals so that they can validate them. _The Difference \(And Relationship\) Between Usability And User Experience._

1. Decide on the things to be considered when assessing the usability of a system?

  
A design is not usable or unusable per se; its features, together with the user, what the user wants to do with it, and the user’s environment in performing tasks, determine its level of usability. A usable interface has three main outcomes:

* It should be easy for the user to become familiar with and competent in using the user interface on the first contact with the website. If we take a travel agent’s website that a designer has made well, the user should be able to move through the sequence of actions to book a ticket quickly.
* It should be easy for users to achieve their objective through using the website. If a user has the goal of booking a flight, a good design will guide them through the easiest process to purchase that ticket.
* It should be easy to recall the user interface and how to use it on subsequent visits. So, a good design on the travel agent’s site means the user should learn from the first time and book a second ticket just as easily.

There are more, such as, a usable interface will be relatively error-free when used.

We can measure usability throughout the development process, from wireframes to prototypes to the final deliverable. Testing can be done with paper and pencil but also remotely when we have higher-fidelity prototypes.  
It’s important to analyze the users’ performance and concerns with a web design as early as possible. From there, we can apply a set of guidelines with a grain of salt; because they tend to be general, we need to adapt them to our specific area. Guidelines show a product’s features proven to improve usability. We can fine-tune design revisions according to these guidelines, as long as we look at all the dimensions. Sometimes, it might just involve tweaking a menu layout; or, it might involve looking much higher.  
_Usability: A part of the User Experience._



1. Find at least one example of a system \(e.g. website, mobile app, etc.\) that demonstrates good usability and one with poor usability. Take screenshots to aid in explaining your reasoning for coming to these conclusions.

"One that comes to mind is those very weak hot air hand dryers at public restrooms. The ones that are so weak that it blows lukewarm air but it doesn't dry your hand, it just makes noise. It's both good and bad depending on who you are. If you are the end-user, It is bad because it gives a false impression that it actually works. Most people try using it for a few seconds before giving up because it takes too long or there's someone waiting. But for businesses, it's quite brilliant cost-wise. Because the hand drying option is provided, they don't have to provide paper towels options. Even though it doesn't work, people don't bother complaining. It is also probably a very cheap device to purchase." Ki Han.

A feature that I love, that improves usability AND UX is auto-fill passwords.   
Having to retype the same password over and over is tiresome and annoying.   
  
A great example of this would be the NMIT moodle website. As a security measure, you have to log in EVERY time you try to access moodle.  
So you have to go to the website, click log in, go to a new page to log in, fill in username and password \(luckily this autofills\) and then it takes you back to moodle home page logged in.   
This whole experience takes about 10-20 seconds, and this time really adds up with how often we use moodle. It is a poor example of usability, and a poor example of UX.
