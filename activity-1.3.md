## Web Development

Web developers build websites using advanced tools. As a web developer, you need to learn high-level coding skills to allow you to build websites or web-based apps. It is a rapidly growing field with high demand as more and more companies continue to upgrade their systems, and with websites becoming increasingly complex and advanced. A Web Developer may work with designers, project managers, marketers, and other stakeholders in order to create the best possible product within the timeframe and budget.

This job appeals to me because you are able to develop websites and apps, problem solve, and code. All of these things interest me.

## Software Tester

 A tester is an individual that tests software or similar projects for bugs, errors, defects or any problems.  The role of a tester is to test out products and provide reports to the project team about any issues or improvements that the product may require.
