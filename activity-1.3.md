## Web Development

Web developers build websites using advanced tools. As a web developer, you need to learn high-level coding skills to allow you to build websites or web-based apps. It is a rapidly growing field with high demand as more and more companies continue to upgrade their systems, and with websites becoming increasingly complex and advanced. A Web Developer may work with designers, project managers, marketers, and other stakeholders in order to create the best possible product within the timeframe and budget.

This job appeals to me because you are able to develop websites and apps, problem solve, and code. All of these things interest me.

## Software Tester

 A tester is an individual that tests software or similar projects for bugs, errors, defects or any problems.  The role of a tester is to test out products and provide reports to the project team about any issues or improvements that the product may require.  
To do so, they analyze a project, identify the types of tests that need to be run, then create a plan to implement these various tests.  
This interests me because it could be useful in a lot of different areas, and could branch off into different testing such as game testing.

## Software Developer

Software Developers invent technology such as apps on mobiles and computers. They have to be creative, innovative, have technical expertise, design programs, work with clients, write new code, or maintain/improve existing code. They also check for bugs in software.  
This appeals to me because it is the future, and it is taking over. Everyday we become more and more dependent on new software and current apps, hundreds of years ago we didn't have anything close to this, but now we are able to develop these insane programs that help us with every part of life, making a lot of things easier. Such as internet and mobile banking, which is a game changer, less busy banks, easier transfers, more efficient systems, and you can control everything from the palm of your hand.
