# Activity 2.2

Riot Games, Inc. is an American video game developer, publisher, and E-sports tournament organizer based in West Los Angeles, California. The company was founded in September 2006. Riot Games operates 24 offices around the world, in which it employs 2,500 staff members. Riot Games is best known for League of Legends, a multiplayer online battle arena game and the company's flagship product.

 The game was first released in October 2009 and subsequently became the game with the highest active player count by 2013. Since 2011, Riot Games also operates various E-sports tournaments for the game, including the League of Legends World Championship, the Championship Series, the European Championship, and the Mid-Season Invitational.

Who do I think their Information Management stakeholders might be ?  
A large database type company  
A massive internet/network security type of company  
E-sports

I really have no idea about stakeholders, but with Riot being such a large, internet based company, I would guess that their stakeholders are in the same area, maybe also marketing, global support.
