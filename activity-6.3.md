**Writing for the web**

There are many aspects to learning how to write effectively for the web, so much so that it could easily form an entire course in it's own right. As an introduction, however, carry out your own research on each of the below and place your findings into the Forum. Check out what other students have discovered

The importance of:

**Knowing your audience.** You have to know your audience in order to know what to actually put in/on the website. What is the user there to achieve ? Can they easily find their info ? Do they need special catering ? \(Old people need a super simple, self explanatory website with minimal interaction and ZERO need for thinking\). A lot of UX techniques have been made to help us further understand our audience straight from the planning phase \(such as user stories, scenarios, personas\).

**Understanding how people read on the web**. Knowing this will help designers know where to put the most important info, and HOW to display the content so that it is read more often. Credibility is important, the internet is full of lies, so links to sources next to information is useful. Eye tracking testing is very helpful to find where your user is looking, and if your content is being read.  
**Summary from  "How Users read on the web":**  
_"They don't. People rarely read Web pages word by word; instead, they scan the page, picking out individual words and sentences."_

**Following the 'inverted pyramid' model -**  "The inverted pyramid refers to a story structure where **the most important information \(or what might even be considered the conclusion\) is presented first**. The who, what, when, where and why appear at the start of a story, followed by supporting details and background information." \(Amy Schade, 2018\).

With this, we can see that it strongly relates to understanding how people read web pages, as pages are often scanned, having the major/important info at the top and the most visible, it is designed to grab the users interest, and convey main info first.

**Keeping content short and simple**, as users will often only scan single words, paragraphs, and pictures, keeping the content short ensures that they receive the information.

**Chunking content,** _"Content chunking is the strategy of breaking up content into shorter, bite-size pieces of information that are more manageable and easier to remember. Because people have a limited capacity in their short-term memory, chunking is a useful technique for designing successful e-learning courses."_ - \(Christie Wroten\).  
Works advantageously with the previously stated techniques.

**Using the active voice:** Here are some short and straightforward examples of active voice.   
-Monkeys adore bananas.  
-The cashier counted the money.  
-The dog chased the squirrel.

**All three sentences have a basic active voice construction:** subject, verb, and object. The subject _monkey_ performs the action described by _adore_. The subject _the cashier_ performs the action described by _counted_. The subject _the dog_ performs the action described by _chased_. The subjects are doing, doing, doing—they _take action_ in their sentences. The active voice reminds us of the popular Nike slogan, “Just Do It.” - \(Catherine Traffis\).

**Putting content into context:**  
Context - the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood.  
Content - What's on the page, in this area would be the elements and information on the site.  
So putting content into context would be making sure that information is clearly displayed, separated \(different pages\), the pages are NAMED with a common name to identify its purpose easily. E.g. blog page is a blog, Login screen is labelled well, and performs login function.

**Editing and proofreading:** Avoid mistakes going live to the site, layout could be messed up after being added to the site, or there could be dangerous typos. Once something is on the internet, it is very difficult to remove it, it is good practice to think anything on the internet is there forever. So the importance of getting it right is very high. Certain mistakes or misinformation can open the company up to risky liabilities.
