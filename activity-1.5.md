## **Business Strategy**

  
**"**Business strategy can be understood as the course of action or set of decisions which assist the entrepreneurs in achieving specific business objectives.  
A business strategy is a set of competitive moves and actions that a business uses to attract customers, compete successfully, strengthening performance, and achieve organisational goals. It outlines ****how business should be carried out to reach the desired ends". [https://businessjargons.com/business-strategy.html](https://businessjargons.com/business-strategy.html)

Corporate Level Strategy: long term goal, company plans made by top level management.  
Business Level Strategy: e.g Managers, who understand the companies vision can make strategies to make that vision become reality  
Functional Level Strategy: First line managers/supervisors, decision making at operational level, day to day business.

## **Organisational Culture**

  
****Organizational culture includes an organization’s expectations, experiences, philosophy, as well as the values that guide member behavior. Culture is based on shared attitudes, beliefs, customs, and written and unwritten rules that have been developed over time. [https://gothamculture.com/what-is-organizational-culture-definition/](https://gothamculture.com/what-is-organizational-culture-definition/)  
Organizational culture can be simplified by explaining it as “the way things are done around here” \(Deal & Kennedy, 2000\).

## **Organisational Structure**

  
**"**The groupings of a company's functions, positions and operations form an organizational structure. Typically, companies express their structures visually on an organizational chart. Charts show the positions within an organizations, the roles they play and the relationships between them -- including supervisory relationships. Focusing on organizational structure and its design helps companies gain clarity on what they are doing currently, their ideal functioning and how they can achieve it".
