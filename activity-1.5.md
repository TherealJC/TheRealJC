# Activity 1.5

Information technology can significantly affect the strategic options, opportunities and issues in many aspects of business. Some of the key impacts of technology are:

* business strategy
* organisational culture
* organisational structure
* business processes
* the nature of work
* the workplace

You are required to:

1. Do your own web research on all of the above.
2. Discuss how they can be impacted by technology.

## **Business Strategy**

  
**"**Business strategy can be understood as the course of action or set of decisions which assist the entrepreneurs in achieving specific business objectives.  
A business strategy is a set of competitive moves and actions that a business uses to attract customers, compete successfully, strengthening performance, and achieve organisational goals. It outlines ****how business should be carried out to reach the desired ends". "_What Is Business Strategy_" \(n.d\).

Corporate Level Strategy: long term goal, company plans made by top level management.  
Business Level Strategy: e.g Managers, who understand the companies vision can make strategies to make that vision become reality  
Functional Level Strategy: First line managers/supervisors, decision making at operational level, day to day business.

So basically business strategy is a blueprint of how the company will move forward to reach their goal, the big guys at the top outline the general strategy or plan, then the mid-tier bosses make strategies on how to implement those plans, and the lower-tier workers carry out the work as required.

Business Strategy has been impacted by the growth of technology in multiple ways, we now have global networks and a much larger market because of it. Also the rapid growth of technology has seen many business strategies change entirely, with more and more people inventing new and improved tech everyday, businesses have had to adopt more flexible strategies to adapt to the constant change in the market, and the technology.

## **Organisational Culture**

  
**"**Organizational culture includes an organization’s expectations, experiences, philosophy, as well as the values that guide member behavior. Culture is based on shared attitudes, beliefs, customs, and written and unwritten rules that have been developed over time". "W_hat is Organisational Culture_" \(2017\).

Organizational culture can be simplified by explaining it as “the way things are done around here” \(Deal & Kennedy, 2000\).

With the advancement of technology, businesses that want to be on top have had to keep up with the latest technology.  
Technology has improved organisational culture through the means of providing efficient and simple communication, better organisational systems, constant improvement on efficiency, provide useful feedback or info to aid a company. Tech helps to improve: performance management, employee recognition, or listening through feedback.

## **Organisational Structure**

  
**"**The groupings of a company's functions, positions and operations form an organizational structure. Typically, companies express their structures visually on an organizational chart. Charts show the positions within an organizations, the roles they play and the relationships between them -- including supervisory relationships. Focusing on organizational structure and its design helps companies gain clarity on what they are doing currently, their ideal functioning and how they can achieve it". _Feigenbaum, Eric._ \(n.d.\).

In "_Impact of Technology on Structure & Design of Organizations"_  \(2017\), the writer says technology can impact an organizational structure by introducing new technology through training, which often means more IT professionals are added to the workplace. Also, improving systems may mean a change in the physical layout of the company, e.g changing from paper work to computers, it may be expensive to do a total re-haul, but it can save the company money in the future, and increase efficiency.



## **Business Process**

 A business process is a collection of linked tasks which find their end in the delivery of a service or product to a client. Also defined as a set of activities and tasks that, once completed, will accomplish an organizational goal. The process must involve clearly defined inputs and a single output. These inputs are made up of all of the factors which contribute \(either directly or indirectly\) to the added value of a service or product. These factors can be categorized into management processes, operational processes and supporting business processes "_Definition of a Business Process_" \(n.d\).

Technology has played a crucial part in improving business processes, completely changing the way that we do business. Faster and more efficient communication, software development, increased productivity, better marketing, improved research, and hugely, automation. The majority of business processes can be improved greatly by use of technology, however, there is risk, lack of employee knowledge or skill can be detrimental to productivity and worker satisfaction, the company could be vulnerable to cyber attacks, the cost involved.

## **The Nature of Work**

The nature of work generally means the type of work someone does e.g job description, scope of work.

Technology has had a massive impact on this by introducing a whole new type of work, IT.   
In our current time, there are hundreds of thousands of different types of work involving IT. Technology is constantly being invented and improved upon, or branching off into something entirely new. Because of this, the nature of work is constantly evolving, aided and effected by increased use and improvements made to technology.

## **Workplace**

Technologies impacts on the workplace

* Improved speed and efficiency, more productivity, menial tasks made redundant or automated. The advancement of communication technologies improves speed and efficiency of communication.
* Team co-ordination, especially good for large businesses that have many employees.
* Improving services, businesses are constantly making changes to aid the way that we as people do things, for example, mobile banking, instead of having to go to the physical location, all banking can now be done online, reducing the amount of people in the stores or in cars polluting the planet. We are constantly making tasks easier through technology.
* I think a negative impact technology can have on the workplace is overuse, especially now with social media becoming almost addicting to most youths.
