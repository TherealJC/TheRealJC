# Self Evaluation

Tasks:  
Self-awareness Explain how you view yourself as a communicator and personal factors and behaviors that influence the way you communicate with others, particularly in work and classroom situations. Use relevant theory and concepts used in class and in the textbook to help explain your answer, \(Oâ€™Rourke, chapter 4 is very worth reading\).   
  
Part 1: Gather feedback from 2 other people. How do they see you as a communicator? Are their views news to you? This feedback should help you understand how you come across to others. Include their responses in your self-analysis.   
  
Part 2: This part of the assignment requires you to reflect on two examples of interpersonal communication that you have been involved within business settings. \(Try to use IT examples if you can\). It may be that you are the employee or the customer. For each example briefly explain the context in which the communication happened and identify and explain the

I have been tasked to evaluate myself in the following ways: how I view myself as a communicator, personal factors and behaviors that influence my communication with others \(work/classroom situations\). I will start by detailing my life up until now, mainly the events that had the most impact on my life. This will help to understand my communication style, and how it has changed.

_**The Past:**_ My name is Jamie Crowther, I was born in Nelson on the 17th of September 1995. I am the youngest in my family, I have 2 older brothers and 2 older sisters. I spent the first 4 years of my life in Motueka, with my 2 older brothers and my parents. My 2 sisters have a different father, that my mother was with before my dad.   
My mum and dad separated in 1999, I was 4 years old. It was very confusing for me at the time, but growing up I realized their separation was mainly caused by being too incompatible, too different from each other. With mum being adventurous and loving change, while dad never embraced change, the opposite in fact, enjoying his repetitive never-changing schedule. My dad is a very strong silent type, he is caring, but very difficult to talk too as he doesn't express himself, or even talk 90% of the time, this is a very big factor on my personality, as I grew up to become quite similar to him communication wise.  
Mum took me and my brother and moved to the North Island, to a horrible place called "Eketahuna", leaving my oldest brother with our dad in Motueka, as he had already started school and made friends.  
My time during primary school was mostly good, I was popular enough, a smart kid that enjoyed learning, playing with friends, cartoons, and gaming.  
Earlier I called Eketahuna horrible, I will explain why, as I think this was a big turning point in my character and personality. During year 8, the last year of primary school, I was heavily bullied by older and intimidating 'gang' kids, or rather, young stupid Maori's with gang related older brothers. They would scare and intimidate me on the way to school, and one time they came to my house trying to provoke a fight. To make it worse, they were bullying me when I had done nothing wrong. At that age I couldn't understand their reasons. I believe this strongly affected my personality and behaviors, the beginning of my reserved, shy, quiet, awkward nature. I spent most of that year inside, playing a game called Final Fantasy 7, avoiding going outside at any costs, mum wouldn't let me skip school however, which upset me at the time, but now I see she was doing her job, and being the youngest, I was already quite spoiled.

After primary school, I moved back down to Motueka to live with my dad and brothers, and to attend high school. The first 2 years of high school I passed both years with distinction, I was a good kid at that point. However during year 11, a lot of changes we're happening, being 15 years old, dealing with puberty e.g being completely focused on girls, partying with friends, socializing, drinking, breaking rules and being a rebellious youth.  
I barely completed year 11, some of year 12, and then went from being part time to full time work. This was where I became fully independent, I moved out of home, worked full time, then eventually quit without acquiring another job first. So obviously I had no money, couldn't get another job, so I had to move back up north to stay with mum while I got back on my feet.  
However instead of sorting my life out, at this point I spiraled downwards, spending my days gaming and smoking weed, slowly fading into obscurity. I became quite depressed for a year, and achieved close to nothing, besides being a burden to others.   
Then in 2017, my brother took me for a road trip to Auckland to see a a concert of an artist that we are both huge fans of, G-Dragon. This was his attempt to re-kindle my hope in life, and try to get me out of my negative space. It worked, and I will always be thankful to my brother for that. I went back to Motueka with him and got a job at Talleys in the Cool store driving a forklift, loading/unloading trucks, computer work, prepping orders for customers.  
This job, being the job that I have spent the most of my working life in, was very important to my personality now. I proved my skills quite early, and a series of events caused me to become the supervisor of night shift for my department. I was excited at the first, but then realized my non-confrontational nature did not work well with the position I was in, where, If I wanted positive change, I had to fight for it, and even then it was unlikely to produce any change.  
This job helped me grow and get my life together, however it also taught me about the world, a lot of these things I viewed as negative. Firstly, the majority of people you work with in workplaces like this are what I would describe as miserable, old, ignorant, and idiotic people who have no concept of common sense. I would often be paired up with a new worker to train them, most of these people older than me, and most of them were really 'simple'. The majority of these workers were far older than me, ranging from late 20s to late 50s. If they we're a good worker, I would get along well with them, I strongly value people who are capable, trustworthy, and respectful. However I was surrounded by incapable, stupid people, which made me start to just complete tasks by myself, and avoid these people. If it was a task that involved any brain work, I would prefer to do it myself as it would get done much quicker and with no problems. I like things done tidily, efficiently, organized. Often I don't think that others can complete the task to my standard, so I prefer to do it myself, that way I know it is 100% on me, and that it will be done well.  
 I worked night shift, roughly 11-12 hours a day, 5-6 days a week. This basically meant that socializing with friends was impossible, they worked opposite hours, and the only day off I had was Sunday, I would sleep through most of Sunday just recovering from the week.  
This harsh lifestyle led me to spiral downward again, as I lived with friends that I loved, but we worked opposite hours and I was often unable to attend our gatherings due to this. At this point of my life, I was already reclusive, but these work circumstances led to me becoming even more reclusive, avoiding communication with people I did not value. This is obviously a very selfish and impractical way to work, but that is my personality. The way that I treat people is very dependent on the other persons skill, capability, trustworthiness, but most importantly, how they treat me.  
I left the job in early 2020 and started studying at NMIT.  
A good thing to come out of Talleys was meeting my best friends and my current girlfriend, who I have dated for the past year. Meeting her would be the biggest event of my life, she constantly helps me to improve.

_**The Present**_  
Now that we've covered the past, I will evaluate myself in the present time.  
Self Concept/ Personality Type Keywords: Reclusive, Reserved, Shy, Anxious, Intellectual, Over thinker, Non-confrontational, non-violent, caring, judgmental, easily irritated, not fond of people \(especially strangers\), Like having my own way, respectful, organization, perfectionist.  
  
I am a very reclusive and reserved person, I am not fond of people, especially people that I don't like. I like to have a small group of close friends.   
I have anxiety problems. I will often try to avoid or ignore people I dislike, I shy away from any confrontation \(often even verbal e.g if trying to prove my point and I think the person isn't understanding, or incapable of understanding, I will quickly give up\), and dislike any amount of attention. If I am the center of attention, I will become an anxious wreck and quickly try to turn the attention elsewhere.  
In my head, I have quite high self-esteem as I think quite highly of myself, however this can easily be shaken, especially by friends whose opinion I care about, or if I don't understand someones opinion about me, but usually I try to not care what other people think. I am very aware of my abilities and what I am able to achieve. I believe myself to be quite an intellectual, however I think this is due to spending so much time in my head, over thinking every little thing, and not optionally. Due to this I can often plan ahead, and know how my actions will affect my life, or others around me.  
When faced with a hard decision, or two opposing views, I am always able to sympathize with both parties reasoning, and understand why they made that decision.

  
I am a very organized person, I don't like unorganized people, I value respect, capability, trust, compassion, and intelligence. I strongly dislike ignorance, stupidity, inefficiency, people who put in no effort.  
I like to do things my way, and If i am to be graded for something, I prefer for it to be based off of purely my own work, I find it difficult to trust others \(I think due to the people I was surrounded by while working at Talleys\), I will reluctantly trust friends, and barely ever trust strangers unless I can see their value.  
I treat people I like completely different from people that I dislike.   
  
If I like someone, or they have matching values, I am very understanding, I will be kind, caring and respectful, I will try to help when asked, and If I see a friend in trouble I will help them, often going out of my way to do so, I will not judge them as harshly as I do others.  
  
If I dislike someone, I will avoid and ignore them if possible, I feel like it's a waste of time to give them any attention. I dislike having to communicate with people I don't value, if forced into a group with strangers, I will instantly get anxious and start questioning why we have to be grouped up. This is strongly due to my previous experiences, I love to be alone, I don't like explaining things to people who can't understand. I despise being grouped with others who don't put in anywhere close to my effort, If I feel like they will negatively affect my final result, I will instantly be judgemental of them and try to limit the amount that they are involved, reducing their contributions.  
  
That all sounds very negative, but it boils down to not trusting others, and my anxiety doesn't allow me to work with other people comfortably. I am a perfectionist, I hate uncertainty, and that's what other people bring, which in turn, amplifies my anxiety and makes me more reclusive.   
However, one of my biggest values is respect, so I will never make any of this known to others, I will often just stay quiet and keep my opinions to myself. If I am the minority, I won't argue my point, even If I believe I am right, because I don't like any form of confrontation, it brings attention, two things i hate. I will simply try to understand their reasoning and stay quiet, occasionally brood, and if I think their reasoning is ridiculous or lazy/unorganized, I will just want to do it myself and become irritated.

  
I don't like to bother others, I will often change my behaviors to not bother people, and in turn, I dislike people who have no self awareness and are constantly interrupting, people who negatively affect all around them with no care, I hate rudeness and ignorance.   
I think in a very selfish way, but I know this about myself, I am very self-aware and self-judgemental, and I just want others to be the same. I will rarely ever share my opinions of others to them, I keep it all in my head, there is no point in saying something that will only cause negative affects. When I am bothered or irritated, I go inward, I get very quiet.  
The big problem that I have with communication is that I don't like it unless it is necessary and convenient, and I don't like wasting any amount of time. So many people just talk without thinking, and their words have no value, no meaning, no thought. For example, small talk, we do it so we don't feel awkward, but I despise small talk as It is always irrelevant, useless information being shared, which results as a waste of time in my opinion.   
  
My communication style is constantly affected by my mood, I can be really social, or my usual quiet self. Even when socializing, I am constantly in my mind, evaluating everything. I am not good with maintaining eye contact, it makes me feel awkward, my body language is quite stiff due to me being aware of how my body looks and trying to look "normal" to others, my communication is very dependent on the environment, for example in a classroom I will be on defense, anxious and nervous due to all the people around me that differ from my style and ideals, but with similar people, I can act confidently and feel more comfortable to be myself.  
I am a lot more comfortable with mediated communicated, like messaging, as this cuts out a lot of non verbal parts of communicating, and is quick and efficient.  
My interpersonal communication is dependent on if I like the person, and if I can see their value or not. My communication with people I like can be improved by me saying what's on my mind, being more open to their opinions and ideas.   
My communication with people I don't value really needs to be improved. I need to work on being assertive, making my opinion known, be more accepting of others flaws, more accepting of others in general, reduce prejudice, try to communicate more.

I took the Jung personality test and had my personality shown as INTJ. I tried the quiz a few times, one while thinking in a positive, social mood, the other with a reclusive mood. Interestingly, all 3 times I received the same result. I was surprised at the accuracy of the test, while reading the INTJ description, I could relate with most of it.  
Here are some examples from my results that show similarities with my self evaluation, backed by proper research.  
  
"People of this type are perfectionists, with a seemingly endless capacity for improving upon anything that takes their interest. What prevents them from becoming chronically bogged down in this pursuit of perfection is the pragmatism so characteristic of the type: INTJs apply \(often ruthlessly\) the criterion "Does it **work**?" to everything from their own research efforts to the prevailing social norms. This in turn produces an unusual independence of mind, freeing them from the constraints of authority, convention, or sentiment for its own sake".

"both perfectionism and disregard for authority may come into play, as INTJs can be unsparing of both themselves and the others on the project. Anyone considered to be "slacking," including superiors, will lose their respect"  
  
"many INTJs do not readily grasp the social rituals; for instance, they tend to have little patience and less understanding of such things as small talk"  
  
"To complicate matters, people of this type are usually extremely private, and can often be naturally impassive as well, which makes them easy to misread and misunderstand,  INTJs really just want people to make sense"  
  
"Probably the strongest INTJ assets in the interpersonal area are their intuitive abilities"

I also took a "Risk Type Profile" which basically highlights your risk taking attitudes, again, I got a result that I could mostly relate to, and that helps confirm my self evaluation. My main 2 types were "Moralist" and "Rational". I will paraphrase from each page the attributes that I can relate to.  
  
"Moralist thinking is analytical and creative, they tend to analyze every situation, they pay more attention and attach more importance to the unfavourable events.  
Moralists are often shy, sensitive people, some of them have problems with communication. Their strong feelings of self respect and dignity accounts for their shyness, although modesty is not the only reason for it. It also arises from a fear that should they act awkwardly, they would lose respect of others. Their fear of defeat appears to be stronger than their desire for victory. Consequently, they are prevented from realizing their capabilities in full and hindered in their advancement in life. In general, they value the harmony in their soul more than the comforts of life. They constantly work to create, maintain and perfect order in their perception of life, trying to avoid inner conflicts with themselves.  
They do not trust their intuition and their intellect appears to be their stronger point; yet, since they are inclined to doubt everything, they do not trust it either. This doubtfulness leads not only to lower level of expectations but also diminished creative potential and drive" _****Moralist Type \(n.d.\)._

"Rational people are good at goal setting and distinguishing between what they really need and what they can easily do without.  Faced with uncertainty and the need to take a risky decision, the Rational start with assessing their chances of success and the potential outcomes of their decisions, both positive and negative.  The Rational are well-prepared to carefully evaluate all potential outcomes of their actions across a variety of scenarios, and routinely do so. They have their own opinions on many socio-political issues but prefer not to impose them on others. They are open-minded but don't like extremism or aggressiveness. They know their limits and are content once they have reached them. They are not egotistical and feel no need to prove their worth to others or demonstrate their own superiority". _Rational Type \(n.d.\)._  
  
_**Feedback \#1**_  
Firstly, I asked my partner to judge my communication, as she is the one who I spend the most time with. I asked her to be brutally honest. She is from Thailand, so English is her second language.  
The main things that she pointed out were:

* I don't like to explain things
* I don't like to talk much
* I'm not really good at expressing my emotions

This all reflects what I am already aware of, nothing new to expand on.  
I don't like to talk much if it isn't about something important, I don't like to negatively affect others, so I usually keep my negative thoughts to myself, which leads to bad expression of my emotions.  
The "I don't like to explain things" i think stems from being too critical of others and being too quick to get irritated, If i am explaining something that I think is simple, and they aren't understanding, I feel like it is a waste of time. They might understand better is they were to research the information themselves.  
Being in a multi-cultural relationship, we rely heavily on non-verbal communication, looking at body language, para-language, and distance can all help with communicating well.  
I am planning to work on speaking my mind, expressing my emotions more, I don't see much reason to talk much
