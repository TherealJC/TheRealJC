# Activity 6.1

**What makes a good web experience?**

As a group:

1. Discuss what you think makes for a good web experience. Draw on your own experiences and preferences.

* Simple design
* Easy to navigate
* Nice layout/structure
* Fulfills its purpose \(The user can easily complete the task they are there for\).
* Efficient use of UI elements
* Consistent design/ consistent navigation, style, font.
* Fun to use

When using a website, I like it to be fun to use, simple, elegant, I can easily do what I am there for, the page tells me what it's doing \(e.g loading bar\), no clutter or large chunks of writing, good use of colour.

1. Consider the different opinions of group members. Does it seem that things like age, culture, previous experience makes a difference?

Definitely, Age and previous experience will often go hand in hand, a lot of the older people have never used, or have very minimal experience with the internet and computers. Opposed to the younger generations who have grown up with technology, watched it evolve, and learned along the way.

Culture can be a huge barrier especially because of language. If your site is only in 1 language, then you are excluding every user that doesn't understand that 1 language. and if you add too many different languages in 1 page is will become cluttered and messy. Often, popular companies will have translated versions of their page content, or a whole different website for that language.

Previous use - If you have never used a computer it will be very difficult to understand how to do anything with it. Elements that most people are familiar with, will have no meaning to them. When designing a website, designers should always plan with this in mind and make processes and UI elements very easy to understand / self explanatory.
