**What is Information Management?**

Information Management includes collection of information and the distribution to audiences, processing and delivering info, classification and coding of records, archiving, developing retention schedules, managing the life cycle, database design and structures, physical storage/electronic/paper, audits, handling of sensitive materials externally/internally.

Information management includes both electronic and physical management. 

Capture, organize, and process the info to the right people at the right time.  
\(Paraphrased from zhuzhu1057's video\)

On AIIM's page "_What is Information Managemen_t" it's claimed that information management falls into these categories. Enterprise Content Management \(ECM\), Electronic Records Management \(ERM\), Business Process Management \(BPM\), Taxonomy and Metadata, Knowledge Management \(KM\), Web Content Management \(WCM\), Document Management \(DM\).

* Information assets are corporate assets. This principle should be acknowledged or agreed upon across the organization.
* Information must be made available and shared. Of course not all information is open to anyone, but in principle the sharing of information helps the use and exploitation of corporate knowledge.
* Information the organization needs to keep is managed and retained corporately.

Information management is a corporate responsibility that needs to be addressed and followed from the top levels of management to the front line worker. Organizations and employees must be accountable to capture, manage, store, share, preserve and deliver information appropriately and responsibly.
