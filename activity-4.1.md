# Activity 4.1

1. Record in your course GitBook in your own words at least 4 challenges you see for incorporating experience design when building a system.

"Those who work on UX \(called UX designers\) study and evaluate how users feel about a system, looking at such things as ease of use, perception of the value of the system, utility, efficiency in performing tasks and so forth. User experience design is all about striving to make them answer “Yes” to all of those questions." _Smashing Magazine_  
This in itself is a challenge, from testing and fixing problems to implementing new features while ensuring the system is enjoyable to use. This would be quite difficult and involve a huge process involving many workers and also users to test the UX.

Websites have become so complex and feature-rich that, to be effective, they must have great user experience designs. This becomes very complex and new technology is constantly being updated, which in turn becomes an ongoing constant job, to keep your website or software up to the best standards that technology, and the business can offer.

Change is needed in a rapidly world, if one does not make their UX enjoyable, there are plenty of other companies who will do the same thing, and maybe better, if a user does not feel value from a software/app, they have many choices to try another, this is why it's important to stay relevant and ensure your UX is looked after.

#### Criticisms Of UX As A Profession <a id="criticisms-of-ux-as-a-profession"></a>

Not everyone sees the value of having a UX designer on the team. Arguments against hiring UX specialists revolve around the perceived associated costs, redundancy in skill set and fear of change.

**UX DESIGN IS NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL**   
User experience design won’t work in every situation for every user because every human is different. What works for one person might have the opposite effect on another. The best we can do is design for specific experiences and promote certain behaviors, but we can’t manufacture, impose or predict the actual experience itself.

And just as we can’t design a user experience, we can’t replicate the user experience for one website exactly on another website. User experiences will be different between websites. a design must be tailored to the goals, values, production process and products of its website.

**CAN’T BE DIRECTLY ASSESSED WITH TRADITIONAL METRICS**  
You can’t determine the effectiveness of a user experience design based solely on statistics such as page views, bounce rates and conversion rates. We can make assumptions, and we can ask users for anecdotal evidence, but we can’t install an app \(at least not yet\) that automatically records user experience statistics directly.
