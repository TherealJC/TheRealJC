Class Discussion as to what you think is the key reason why utilising an SDLC is important.

**Why the need for development life cycles?**

**SDLC** stands for **S**oftware **D**evelopment **L**ife**C**ycle and it is the process of developing information system with proper analysis, design, implementation and maintenance.   
****SDLC is important because it breaks down the entire life cycle of software development thus make is easier to evaluate each part of software development and also makes it easier for programmers to work concurrently on each phase.  
The field of Software Engineering is relatively new and introduction of scientific approaches for software development has been a recent phenomenon. As software use proliferated in late 70s and early 80s, and as programming languages evolved from assembly languages to higher level procedural and object oriented languages, software development experts in industry and universities started looking for ways to improve quality and reliability of their products. The result was introduction and refinement of Software Development Life Cycle \(SDLC\) and other formal development methodologies that were based on SDLC. "_The Importance of SDLC" \(2010\)._

I  think SDLC is a crucial part of software development. Through planning, analysis, and information management, people are able to reduce costs, plan efficiently, know the estimated life cycle of the software and what needs to be done.
